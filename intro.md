# Introduction

- Spectral methods can produce arbitrary higher order methods
- Higher order methods are beneficial for problems that necessitate well resolved fine details of the solution or long time integrations
- Spectral methods are global methods
- In global methods, computation at a given point depends upon the information at the entire domain

## Why do we need higher order methods?

For slowly varying functions, it is better to use low order polynomial approximation, which is local in nature. However, using low order polynomial approximation for solutions with significant spatial-temporal variation requires a very fine grid in order to accurately resolve the function.

## Applications of spectral methods

- The first spectral method computations were simulations of homogeneous turbulence on periodic domains
